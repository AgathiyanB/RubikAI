# NeuralNetwork
Initially was an attempt at a Rubik's cube AI, now realising that is a bit of jump, this is going to be a collection of neural networking applications, building up to a Rubik's cube AI.

I have kept the code used to represent and display the cube in the repo though as like I said, the goal of this project is to eventually be able to tackle the cube.

Also as this is a learning experience, chances are there will be a lot missing so feel free to let me know where the project could be improved.
